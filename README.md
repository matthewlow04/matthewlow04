👋 Hi, I'm Matthew Low, a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo from Markham, Ontario.

🎓 I'm most passionate about iOS development, with strong experience in Swift. While iOS is my primary focus, I’m also skilled in various other areas and always eager to learn and expand my skill set.

📱 iOS Skills
- Frameworks & Tools: SwiftUI, UIKit, Firebase, CoreData, SwiftData, Xcode, Swift Package Manager
- Architecture & Testing: MVVM, Unit Testing with XCTest and Swift Testing
- Networking: RESTful APIs, URLSession, CRUD

🏀 I thrive on coding, problem-solving, and designing practical mobile apps that make a difference. Outside of tech, I'm passionate about music and sports—whether it's exploring new music, watching hockey or basketball, or staying active through sports, these interests keep me balanced and inspired.
